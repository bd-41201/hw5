We’ll explore casts for ‘drama’ movies from 1980-1999. See actors example code and data.
I’ve limited the data to actors in more than ten productions over this time period (and to movies
with more than ten actors).

[1] The actors network has an edge if the two actors were in the same movie. Plot the entire actors
network.

[2] Plot the neighborhoods for “Bacon, Kevin” at orders 1-3. How does the size of the network
change with order?

[3] Who were the most common actors? Who were most connected? Pick a pair of actors and describe
the shortest path between them.

[4] Find pairwise actor-cast association rules with at least 0.01% support and 10% confidence.
Describe what you find.

[+] What would be a regression based alternative to ARules?
Execute it for a single RHS actor
